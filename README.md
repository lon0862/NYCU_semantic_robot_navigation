# semantic_robot_navigation
In this repository, I complete Semantic Robot Navigation for the HW3 of Perception and Decision Making in Intelligent Systems, NYCU, in fall 2022.

# Abstact
In the HW2, we successfully reconstructed a 3D semantic map of apartment_0.
In this job, we will show how to navigate from point A to B on the first floor of apartment_0 using the RRT algorithm.
